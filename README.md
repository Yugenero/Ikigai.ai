## Front-End

- React Native (Expo or Bare Workflow)
    - Components: Ok so apparently the best UI/Component Library for React Native is just regular stylesheets
        - StyleSheets
        - UI Kitten
    - Animations: I will think about thisâ€¦.
- React Forms for user text input
- React Navigation & Zustand (for state management + navigation)

## Back-End

- Firebase Auth & Firestore (or Supabase) or MongoDB
- OpenAI API + Hugging Face models (for insights)
- API Framework: Node.js/Express.js for serving API Calls
- Might have to use flask somewhere for AI processing
