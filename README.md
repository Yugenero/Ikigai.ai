## Front-End

- React Native (Expo or Bare Workflow)
    - Components: Ok so apparently the best UI/Component Library for React Native is just regular stylesheets
        - StyleSheets → Creating your own custom components
        - UI Kitten → Probably going to consider using this due to it’s ease of use and Tailwind like implementation
    - Animations: I will think about this….
- React Forms for user text input
- React Navigation & Zustand (for state management + navigation)

## Back-End

- Firebase Auth & Firestore (or Supabase) or MongoDB
- OpenAI API + Hugging Face models (for insights)
- API Framework: Node.js/Express.js for serving API Calls
- Might have to use flask somewhere for AI processing

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```
